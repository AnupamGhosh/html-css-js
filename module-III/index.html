            In West Bengal, a thick soupy mixture of vegetables in a ginger-mustard sauce called Shukto usually follows the bitter starting
            course, but sometimes replaces it as a starter altogether. Eaten in much bigger portions, Shukto is usually eaten
            in summer. It is a complex dish, featuring a fine balance of many different tastes and textures and is often
            a critical measure of a Bengali cook's abilities in the kitchen A favourite Bengali palate cleanser, made with
            a lot of different vegetables including at least one bitter veg, simmered with a hint of sugar and milk to bring
            out the bitterness of the fresh vegetables.

          <div>
            Roshogolla is a syrupy dessert popular in the Indian subcontinent and regions with South Asian diaspora. It is made from
            ball shaped dumplings of chhena (an Indian cottage cheese) and semolina dough, cooked in light syrup made of
            sugar. This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings. The dish originated in East India; the present-day
            states of Odisha and West Bengal are variously claimed to be the birthplace of the dish. Roshogolla is derived
            from the words rosh ("juice") and golla ("ball")

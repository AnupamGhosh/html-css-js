            <div>
                Roshogolla is a syrupy dessert popular in the Indian subcontinent and regions with South Asian diaspora. It is made from
                ball shaped dumplings of chhena (an Indian cottage cheese) and semolina dough, cooked in light syrup made
                of sugar. This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings. The dish originated in East India; the present-day
                states of Odisha and West Bengal are variously claimed to be the birthplace of the dish. Roshogolla is derived
                from the words rosh ("juice") and golla ("ball")
